# Introduction



Over the years, fossil fuels have played significant roles in supplying energy for heating and power generation to the human population. Various factors, including global demand, government policies, economic considerations, and technological advancements, have influenced energy availability. In this analysis, I employ an up-to-date dataset concerning futures related to major fossil fuels to offer the following:
Trend Analysis and Market Dynamics: analyse and scrutinize price fluctuation patterns to predict future market trends in the energy industry.
Trading and Investment Strategies: utilize the dataset to test trading and investment strategies based on energy fuel dynamics.
Risk Management: provide insights into hedging and managing portfolio risks.
The dataset comprises 8 columns for the combined data, whereas the individual data contains 6 columns.
Column Descriptions:
1. Date: Trading Days from 2000 to 2023. Format: YYYY-MM-DD.
2. Open Market's opening price for the day.
3. High: Peak price during the trading window.
4. Low: Lowest traded price during the day.
5. Close: End of day(EOD) prices.
6. Volume: The quantity of contracts traded during the trading period.
7. Ticker: The unique market quotation symbol for the commodity.
8. Commodity: Indicates the type of fuel to which the future contract is related, such as crude oil or natural gas.

The volatility, profitability and pairwise correlation of the commodities were analysed to gain insight into the dataset.
